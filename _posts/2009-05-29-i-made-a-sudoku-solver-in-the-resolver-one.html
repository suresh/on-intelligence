<img src="/tumblr_files/QtbOTch70o1sqrtb6XylxZ8so1_400.png"/><br/><p>I made a Sudoku Solver in the Resolver One environment, using the Microsoft Solver Foundation. The kernel of this sheet is to implement Sudoku as a constrained solver problem and let the solver arrive at the rest of the grid.  This is part of the challenge at Resolver Systems and I would post links to these files once its over.</p>
<p>This is derived from this <a target="_self" title="Sudoku as Constraint Program" href="http://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.com/2008/11/sudoku-constraint-programming-vs-mip.html">post </a>by ERWIN KALVELAGEN which shows OML and Excel integration.</p>
