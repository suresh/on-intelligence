<p>Quantitative clustering techniques solely rely on grouping a bunch of stocks based on returns and their correlations, seems to fail while trying to classify a set of stocks in an industry. I ran a test on set of 20 stocks from utilities and couldn&rsquo;t find meaningful clusters just based on this data analysis alone.</p>
<p>Another technique which helped me though was the fundamental classification method. I created a vector of factors for this sector and rated each stock&rsquo;s exposure to this factor. Then grouping stocks which had very similar factor weights seemed to show a lot of promise.</p>
<p>I should take examples from Indian stocks and elucidate this more clearly in the next post on this topic.</p>
