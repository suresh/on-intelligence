<p>Over the past couple of years <a href="http://infiniteundo.com/post/things-you-should-test" title="I wrote a checklist of things that are worth testing in almost any software system. These are general areas where bugs and errors tend to cluster.">I have spent a lot of time</a> debugging
other engineersâ€™ test code. This was interesting work, occasionally
frustrating but always informative. One might not immediately think
that test code would have bugs, but of course <em>all</em> code has bugs and
tests are no exception.</p> </blockquote>
