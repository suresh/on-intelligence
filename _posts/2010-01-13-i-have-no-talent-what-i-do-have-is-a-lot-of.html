title: I have no talent. What I do have is a lot of practice. And I am not talking
  about occasionally dabbling in Ruby on the weekends. I am talking about the kind
  of practice where I beat code that isn’t working into submission (though often times
  the code wins). The kind of practice where all of a sudden I realize that it is
  2am and I’m exhausted physically so I should go to bed, but mentally I feel on fire
  so I let the code have me for another hour or two (I imagine this state to be like
  a marathon runner or ironman near the end of their race).
