<p>Tufte codified the design process into six principles: &ldquo;(1) documenting the sources and characteristics of the data, (2) insistently enforcing appropriate comparisons, (3) demonstrating mechanisms of cause and effect, (4) expressing those mechanisms quantitatively, (5) recognizing the inherently multivariate nature of analytic problems, (6) inspecting and evaluating alternative explanations.&rdquo; In brief, &ldquo;information displays should be documentary, comparative, causal and explanatory, quantified, multivariate, exploratory, skeptical.</p>
