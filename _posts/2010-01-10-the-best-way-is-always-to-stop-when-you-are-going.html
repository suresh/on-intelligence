title: The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what
  will happen next. If you do that every day … you will never be stuck. Always stop
  while you are going good and don’t think about it or worry about it until you start
  to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time.
  But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your
  brain will be tired before you start.
