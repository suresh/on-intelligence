title: You see people, the alpha males have business degrees. They can be fat and
  pasty, pretty boy douchebags, or even ugly serial killers, but if they have an MBA
  from a 6 month “executive program” then they’re ALPHA. They have the ideas. They
  have the balls. They’re full of testosterone. Now me, I learned to actually do something
  with my brain besides take people’s money, which means I’m not a real man. My ideas
  don’t mean anything and I’m just supposed to let the adults talk.
