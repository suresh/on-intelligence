title: Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough
  or frightened enough to hold it back. Itâ€™s time to stop complying with the system
  and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential,
  and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must.
