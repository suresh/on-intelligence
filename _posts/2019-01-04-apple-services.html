<p>Apple services especially iTunes and Maps are a sad placeholder in countries like China and India. While iOS is a solid ecosystem with apps, the services from them typically underwhelming and often don’t even work.</p><p>Apple focuses on the premium consumers in these markets on the basis of hardware and not enough software or services backing. What makes it even worse is the pathetic retail experience.</p><p>Smartphone market is very differentiated in these markets and usual Apple playbook doesn’t really work.</p>
