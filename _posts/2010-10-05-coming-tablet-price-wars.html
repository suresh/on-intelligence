<p>How much does Apple spends on the iPad hardware?<br/>
Recently introduced AppleTV has the A4 chip along with wireless chip and 8GB flash memory. This teardown at <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple-TV-2nd-Generation-Teardown/3625/1">iFixit</a> shows the internals of this device is very similar to an iPad.</p>

<p>This implies that except the display and associated driving chips, Apple&rsquo;s cost on iPad could be way below $99. There are median of several estimates for the cost of iPad display is about $150. </p>

<p>With announcements of other tablet devices, Apple could really take them on the price game. They already have immense purchasing power in flash and display market.</p>

<p>Apple could most probably stick with current prices and add more powerful chips. We could see the iPod story repeat in the tablet market.</p>
