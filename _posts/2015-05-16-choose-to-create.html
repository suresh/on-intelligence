<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I&rsquo;m done criticizing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m through judging other people&rsquo;s work, critiquing every flaw. I&rsquo;m finished sitting on the sidelines, pretending I can play. I&rsquo;m done watching others produce, while I only consume. I&rsquo;m over feeling important and powerful and authoritative &ndash; self-righteous - at the expense of others. I&rsquo;m past pushing others down on my way up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m bored with it all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there isn&rsquo;t a place for critics. I&rsquo;m only saying I&rsquo;m leaving that group. And I&rsquo;m heading out on my own to create something new.</p>
