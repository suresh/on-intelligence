<a href="http://www.deliberatism.com/blog/forget-self-improvement/">Deliberate Improvement</a><br/><p>Ever wonder how some people accomplish so much? They run marathons, write novels, start companies… without making it seem like a big deal?</p>

<p>Well, it is a big deal. And in spite of how effortless these accomplishments may appear, people work harder than you likely realize to make these things happen. There is, however, one thing they know—at least in practice—that you don’t.</p>

<p>Most of us want to finish the race, but see running as a chore. A few dream about being great authors, but find the writing itself to be slow and difficult. Some of us learn all we can about starting a company, only to hit a wall when it comes time to get down to work.</p>

<p>Self-help books and workshops arm us with ways to trick ourselves into doing things we perhaps should, but generally don’t want, to do. I ask whether this lack of will might actually be the universe trying to tell us something?</p>

<p>Maybe you aren’t supposed to bother with the tedious stuff. Perhaps the reason you haven’t done it yet, is that you weren’t meant to. Might achievement, as a goal unto itself, be pointless? Could this need to have done something notable, simply be greed in a more socially-acceptable form?</p>

<p>More than all of the rest, though: What if the missing part of the puzzle is not a lack of willpower, but instead a lack of love?</p>

<p>The runner discovers tranquility on the road, forgetting the pain. The writer gives in to the joy of playing with words, moving past the aggravation. The entrepreneur finds purpose in making something, and stops noticing the long days.</p>

<p>You can spend your life fretting about how healthy, interesting, or successful you are. In fact, a whole industry depends upon this, and is eager to help you make plans to change.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might consider simply finding what you love, and letting the rest take care of itself.</p>
