<p>Seth Godin talk about artists and their leverage in the new connected world.</p>
<p>Today, I listened to <a title="Sophie" href="http://sophiemadeleine.bandcamp.com">Sophie Madeleine</a>. She is so talented. She chose to sell her own music, instead of going the record route of publishing music. It is now possible for quality content to be distributed more easily than ever before. I think the days of studios and arbiters of any art, are counted.</p>
<p>But, India as a music market puzzles me. Where is the money to be made in here? May be live performances, souvenirs or donations. May be I need to think of possibility of Indie India.</p>
