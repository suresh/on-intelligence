<blockquote>You&rsquo;re not your job. You&rsquo;re not how much money you have in the bank. You&rsquo;re not the car you drive. You&rsquo;re not the contents of your wallet. You&rsquo;re not your fucking khakis. You&rsquo;re the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world</blockquote>&#8212;Tyler Durden, Fight Club
