<p>What’s the difference between goals and systems?</p>

<p>If you’re a coach, your goal is to win a championship. Your system is what your team does at practice each day.</p>

<p>If you’re a writer, your goal is to write a book. Your system is the writing schedule that you follow each week.</p>

<p>If you’re a runner, your goal is to run a marathon. Your system is your training schedule for the month.</p>

<p>If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a million dollar business. Your system is your sales and marketing process.</p>
