title: Learn an industry like the back of your hand. Be able to tell me the names
  of each and every CEO and CFO across the industry and what their Modus Operandi
  in terms of management and capital allocation are. Be able to contact many people
  in the supply chain to get a sense of whatâ€™s going on on the ground for distributors,
  buyers, etc. Know the customers and how companies are differentiating themselves
  from one another whether on price, service, quality, etc. Know the Wall Street analysts
  to get an understanding of the consensus view and be able to tell me why and how
  they are wrong. Even better, know other buy side analysts and understand their views
  and why THEY are also wrong. Like Li Lu has said, evaluate and know the business
  like you inherited it. I think by doing this, you will make yourself much more valuable
  and marketable for the years to come.
