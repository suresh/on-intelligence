<p>I wish Apple could make a computing device that would make Wacom Cintiq redundant. Cintiq behaves like a hardware peripheral made by elves and not like a computing device by itself.</p>
<p>My ideal product for touch, brush/tool based computer, follows this premise &lsquo;everything is the screen&rsquo;. No haggling with the cables and all the other nasty bits.</p>
<p>Apple whip out a product for this, please.</p>
