title: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
  man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
  belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and
  sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again;
  because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually
  strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends
  himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
  achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly.
  So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither
  victory nor defeat.
