title: 'GORILLA society, power belongs to silverback males. These splendid creatures
  have numerous status markers besides their back hair: they are bigger than the rest
  of their band, strike space-filling postures, produce deeper sounds, thump their
  chests lustily and, in general, exude an air of physical fitness. Things are not
  that different in the corporate world. The typical chief executive is more than
  six feet tall, has a deep voice, a good posture, a touch of grey in his thick, lustrous
  hair and, for his age, a fit body. Bosses spread themselves out behind their large
  desks. They stand tall when talking to subordinates. Their conversation is laden
  with prestige pauses and declarative statements.'
