<p>Today, I got really intrigued by the <a title="Amazon DTP" href="http://dtp.amazon.com/">Kindle Digital Text platform</a> for publishing ebooks. Amazon recently announce that it would increase the royalty paid for the books to 70%. But there is fine print to this news, this program comes in effect in June 2010 and is applicable only to the content that gets sold in US.</p>
<p>So, the royalty rates are going to stay at 30% for sometime to come or until Apple does something radical next week. But, this Amazon platform offers quite a new mechanism for ebooks publishing and I believe people are going to consume more books and content than they did earlier. This is turn of book publishing to be democratised.</p>
<p>I have been contemplating on the possibility of launching a ebook for quite a while. I intend to do an ebook on finance topics which could be used as primers/guides for getting an understanding on specific topics.</p>
