<p>I got a new phone - Samsung i7500 Galaxy. Looks like it is going to be more fun than my older phones.</p>
<p>1. Samsung i7500 Galaxy runs the Android 1.5 platform. So I downloaded the sdk tools from google and then followed their readme to get started with getting the 1.5 platform specific downloads on my mac.</p>
<p>2. I got the Galaxy skin from rexxar, for better looks. Got eclipse and ran couple of examples on the phone.</p>
<p>Now I need to implement couple of ideas for the phone, first the indian real time stock market app in similar lines to google finance app and notes app which is simple enough and syncs with my dropbox account.</p>
