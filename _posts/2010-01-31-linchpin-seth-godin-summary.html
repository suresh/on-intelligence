<p><b>Quieting the lizard brain</b></p>
<p>How can I explain the never ending irrationality of human behavior?</p>
<p>We say we want one thing, then we do another. We say we want to be successful but we sabotage the job interview. We say we want a product to come to market, but we sandbag the shipping schedule. We say we want to be thin but we eat too much. We say we want to be smart but we skip class or don&rsquo;t read the book the boss lent us.</p>
<p>The contradictions never end. When someone shows up and acts without contradictions, we are amazed. When an athlete just does the sport, or when a writer just writes the words, we can&rsquo;t help but watch, astonished at the purity of their actions. Why is it so difficult to do what we say we are going to do?</p>
<p>The lizard brain. Or as Steven Pressfield describes it, the resistance. The resistance is the voice in the back of our head telling us to back off, be careful, go slow, compromise. The resistance is writer&rsquo;s block and putting jitters and every project that ever shipped late because people couldn&rsquo;t stay on the same page long enough to get something out the door.</p>
<p>The resistance grows in strength as we get closer to shipping, as we get closer to an insight, as we get closer to the truth of what we really want. That is because the lizard hates change and achievement and risk.</p>
<p>The lizard is a physical part of your brain, the pre-historic lump near the brain stem that is responsible for fear and rage and reproductive drive. Why did the chicken cross the road? Because her lizard brain told her to.</p>
<p>Want to know why so many companies can&rsquo;t keep with Apple? It&rsquo;s because they compromise, have meetings, work to fit in, fear the critics and generally work to appease the lizard. Meetings are just one symptom of an organization run by the lizard brain. Late launches, middle of the road products and the rationalization that goes with them are others.</p>
<p>The amygdala isn&rsquo;t going away. Your lizard brain is here to stay, and your job is to figure out how to quiet it and ignore it. This is so important, I wanted to put it on the cover of my new book. We realized though, that the lizard brain is freaked out by a picture of itself, and if you want to sell books to someone struggling with the resistance (that would be all of us) best to keep it a little more on the down low.</p>
<p>Now you have seen the icon and you know its name. What are you going to do about it?</p>
