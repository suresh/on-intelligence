title: The best designers and the best programmers aren’t the ones with the best skills,
  or the nimblest fingers, or the ones who can rock and roll with photoshop or vim,
  they are the ones that can determine what just doesn’t matter. That’s where the
  real gains are made. Most of the time you spend is wasted time on things that just
  don’t matter. If you can cut out the work and thinking that just doesn’t matter
  you’ll achieve productivity you’ve never imagined. It’s there if you just don’t
  pay attention to the things that don’t matter.
