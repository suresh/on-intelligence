## 100 Posts of Machine Learning

Here is my attempt at creating content that I would like to comeback over the course of the next few years. These posts are single ideas taken from start to completion. Each should be a standalone document that can be referred multiple times.

## My tools

I use a AWS t2 micro machine to create everything about these posts. I use an iPad as primrary device for creating these ML posts.

Update on the tools front, I have now moved fully to AWS Sagemaker notebook instances and reducing the need for EC2 instance and associated setup. This is very liberating.
