<p>Read an inspiring <a title="Post" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=937430">post</a> from Hackernews recent:</p>
<p>Poster: I am lost. I don&rsquo;t own my home, I don&rsquo;t have lots of savings, I have a job with a difficult  boss. Because of the hours I work and the city I live in, I barely see my boo. I am utterly unhappy with my life. Where should I turn? And what would you do?</p>
<p><br/>I am tempted to totally change my life and stop working and create something new that will be challenging and interesting. Create something that I can do from home so that at least I am not a slave to my job.</p>
<p><br/><br/>Responder: &quot;Don&rsquo;t feel guilty if you don&rsquo;t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn&rsquo;t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don&rsquo;t&quot;.<br/>First, tell your wife exactly what you have written here. I have been working only on projects that interest me ever since. It was/is scary. We have to reduce our standard of living, but the days have turned from drudgery to adventure. Even if we end up living in a van by the river, it will have been well worth it.<br/>Only you can know what is best for you, but as someone who has walked this path, I encourage you to follow your heart. Poverty is uncomfortable, but regret is excruciating.</p>
