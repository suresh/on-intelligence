A great way to build your email list is to offer a newsletter.</p>
<p>Simply placing an opt-in form on your website isn’t enough to build a large subscriber list. Sure, you will get the occasional subscriber here and there, but if you want to aggressively grow your list consider these five options.</p>
<p>1. Include an opt-in form after each blog post.</p>
<p>By placing an opt-in form at the bottom of each blog post you are catching the visitor at the perfect time — right after they finish reading your content. If your content provided value the visitor will be more willing to hand over his or her email address to continue engaging with your brand.</p>
<p>If your website is built using WordPress there are several free plugins that allow you to create several customizable styles of opt-in forms and integrate them with your email marketing service. Optin Forms and WP Conversion Boxes are two great options.</p>
