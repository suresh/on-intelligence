title: Instead of thinking what you want to do, think about who you want to be. Picture
  how your identity will change as the result of your decision. Are you the type of
  person who works for a casual, laid-back company, or the type of person who makes
  more money and wears a suit every day? In a way, our decisions construct our identities,
  so use this strategy to help you figure out who you want to be.
