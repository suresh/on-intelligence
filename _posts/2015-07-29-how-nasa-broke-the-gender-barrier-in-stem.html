<blockquote><p><b>The notorious lack of women in leadership roles in STEM seems to run 
rampant</b> everywhere—everywhere except NASA, an administration that not 
only puts women at the helm, but continually gives them a platform to 
drive the larger conversation around the need for more women in the 
sciences.<br/><br/>
Case in point: Dr. Ellen Stofan serves as the chief scientist of NASA. 
Deborah Diaz is NASA’s chief technology officer for IT. Teresa Vanhooser
 runs one of NASA’s largest facilities in the U.S. responsible for 
building rockets.</p><p>Dr. Tara Ruttley manages the science programs aboard the 
International Space Station. For the first time, half of an astronaut 
class consists of women. And now, through the convening of a new user 
community called Datanaut Corps, NASA is unlocking opportunities for 
women entrepreneurs in the tech and maker communities to use the 
agency’s infinite gigabytes of open data to pioneer space-inspired data 
science.</p></blockquote>
