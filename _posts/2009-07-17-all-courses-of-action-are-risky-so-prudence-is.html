<blockquote>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it&rsquo;s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.</blockquote>&#8212;Niccolo Machiavelli
