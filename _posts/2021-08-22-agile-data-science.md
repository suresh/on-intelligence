* Algorithm trails
* Model improvements
* Data exploration

The best way to bring predictability to your Data Science team is to interlace the research and operational work. So in every sprint, you’ll do both, but on different topics. You’ll research ahead and do the operation for the area/opportunities you already got successful outputs from your research.
