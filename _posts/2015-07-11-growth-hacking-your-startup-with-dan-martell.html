<p>Week 2 of <a href="http://blackbox.vc/" title="Blackbox Connect" target="_blank">Blackbox Connect</a>. Off to a blazing start today with <a href="http://www.danmartell.com/" title="Dan Martell" target="_blank">Dan Martell</a>, on <em>Social Marketing for Startups.</em></p>

<p>Dan was founder of <a href="http://www.flowtown.com/blog/" title="Flowtown" target="_blank">Flowtown</a>, acquired last year by Demandforce. He’s currently working on <a href="http://clarity.fm/getnotified" title="Clarity.fm" target="_blank">another startup</a>, while advising and investing in others. He calls himself a growth hacker.</p>
<p>I like that title. It explains what pretty much every startup with lean marketing budget is trying to do.</p>
<p>His weapon of choice? Social media. Results kinda speak for themselves: ~22K Twitter followers; 17K Facebook fans; 15K email subscribers in the very early days.</p>
<p>He shared some killer insights into what worked at Flowtown. I managed to capture a few. </p>
