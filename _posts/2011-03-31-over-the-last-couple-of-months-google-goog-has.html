title: 'Over the last couple of months Google (GOOG) has reached out to the major
  carriers and device makers backing its mobile operating system with a message: There
  will be no more willy-nilly tweaks to the software. No more partnerships formed
  outside of Google’s purview. From now on, companies hoping to receive early access
  to Google’s most up-to-date software will need approval of their plans. And they
  will seek that approval from Andy Rubin, the head of Google’s Android group.'
