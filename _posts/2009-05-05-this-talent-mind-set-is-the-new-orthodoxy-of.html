<blockquote>This “talent mind-set” is the new orthodoxy of American management. It is the intellectual justiﬁcation for why such a high premium is placed on degrees from ﬁrst-tier business schools, and why the compensation packages for top executives have become so lavish. In the modern corporation, the system is considered only as strong as its stars, and, in the past few years, this message has been preached by consultants and management gurus all over the world. None, however, have spread the word quite so ardently as McKinsey, and, of all its clients, one ﬁrm took the talent mind-set closest to heart. It was a company where McKinsey conducted twenty separate projects, where McKinseyʼs billings topped ten million dollars a year, where a McKinsey director regularly attended board meetings, and where the C.E.O. himself was a former McKinsey partner. The company, of course, was Enron.</blockquote>&#8212;The Talent Myth by Malcolm Gladwell, download a free copy <a title="Talent Myth" href="http://www.changethis.com/6.TalentMyth">here</a>.
