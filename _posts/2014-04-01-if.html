<p>BY RUDYARD KIPLING</p>

<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br/>
	Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br/>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br/>
	But make allowance for their doubting too;<br/>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br/>
	Or being lied about, don&rsquo;t deal in lies,<br/>
Or being hated, don&rsquo;t give way to hating,<br/>
	And yet don&rsquo;t look too godd, not talk too wise:</p>

<p>If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;<br/>
	If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;<br/>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br/>
	And treat those two impostors just the same;<br/>
If you can bear to hear the truth you&rsquo;ve spoken<br/>
	Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br/>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br/>
	And stoop and build &lsquo;em up with worn-out tools:</p>

<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br/>
	And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br/>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br/>
	And never breathe a word about your loss;<br/>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br/>
	To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br/>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br/>
	Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!&rsquo;</p>

<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br/>
	Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,<br/>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br/>
	If call men count with you, but none too much;<br/>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br/>
	With sixty seconds&rsquo; woth of distance run,<br/>
Yours is the Earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it,<br/>
	And-which is more-you&rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!</p>
