<p>My year in 2009 was pretty adventurous and difficult at times. Time with family was crucial and helped stabilize emotions. Boo and I are making progress towards our goals. Career has been all over the place, but finally showing signs of direction. Overall my best year so far, making me a better human.<br/><br/>Looking forward<br/><br/>I am feeling so optimistic about 2010 and I want to be happy with Boo. I know resolutions are lame, but I make them all the time.  So this year, I’m writing them down here.</p>
<p><br/>Here my resolutions are, :<br/></p>
<ul><li> Lose weight (of course!)</li>
<li>Get on a regular sleep schedule</li>
<li>Laugh more often, be less easily offended, don’t take things personally, don’t get so defensive when you’re wrong</li>
<li>Check in with my family more frequently</li>
<li>Go somewhere new every few months</li>
<li>Write code more</li>
<li>Take more photographs</li>
<li>Start learning guitar</li>
<li>Learn to cook daily</li>
<li>Keep a plant alive</li>
<li>Listen, don’t interrupt or be distracted</li>
<li>Go outside at least every now and then</li>
<li>At the end of each day, have a clean space for the following day’s work</li>
<li>Try not live in a gross room</li>
<li>Don’t put things off quite so badly</li>
<li>Reduce my debt</li>
